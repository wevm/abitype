# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to ABIType! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request.**

If you want to contribute, but aren't sure where to start, you can create a [new discussion](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/abitype/discussions).

> **Note** **Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**
>
> It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create a [feature request](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/abitype/discussions/new?category=ideas) to first discuss any API changes or significant new ideas.

## Cloning the repository

To start contributing to the project, clone it to your local machine using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wagmi-dev/abitype.git
```

Or the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com):

```bash
gh repo clone wagmi-dev/abitype
```

## Installing Node.js and pnpm

ABIType uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as its package manager. You need to install **Node.js v16 or higher** and **pnpm v7 or higher**.

You can run the following commands in your terminal to check your local Node.js and npm versions:

```bash
node -v
pnpm -v
```

If the versions are not correct or you don't have Node.js or pnpm installed, download and follow their setup instructions:

- Install Node.js using [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) or from the [official website](https://nodejs.org)
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

</div>

## Installing dependencies

Once in the project's root directory, run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

After the install completes, pnpm links packages across the project for development and [git hooks](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks) are set up.

> **Note:** In case you have to install new packages or upgrade packages make sure to use **pnpm@8.3.1** and **typescript@5.0.4**

<div align="right">
  <a href="#basic-guide">&uarr; back to top</a></b>
</div>

## Running tests

Tests are run with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/testing-types.html):

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm test:typecheck
```

> **Note** Ensure to build the package (`pnpm build`) before running the `test:typecheck` suite.

## Writing documentation

Documentation lives in the `docs` directory and in code using [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org). If you think something is unclear or could be explained better, you are welcome to open a pull request. To run the docs site, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm docs:dev
```

## Submitting a pull request

When you're ready to submit a pull request, you can follow these naming conventions:

- Pull request titles use the [Imperative Mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood) (e.g., `Add something`, `Fix something`).
- [Changesets](#versioning) use past tense verbs (e.g., `Added something`, `Fixed something`).

When you submit a pull request, GitHub will automatically lint, build, and test your changes. If you see an ❌, it's most likely a bug in your code. Please, inspect the logs through the GitHub UI to find the cause.

## Versioning

When adding new features or fixing bugs, we'll need to bump the package versions. We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to do this.

> **Note** Only changes to the codebase that affect the public API or existing behavior (e.g. bugs) need changesets.

Each changeset defines which package(s) should be published and whether the change should be a major/minor/patch release, as well as providing release notes that will be added to the changelog upon release.

To create a new changeset, run `pnpm changeset`. This will run the Changesets CLI, prompting you for details about the change. You’ll be able to edit the file after it’s created — don’t worry about getting everything perfect up front.

Even though you can technically use any markdown formatting you like, headings should be avoided since each changeset will ultimately be nested within a bullet list. Instead, bold text should be used as section headings.

If your PR is making changes to an area that already has a changeset (e.g. there’s an existing changeset covering theme API changes but you’re making further changes to the same API), you should update the existing changeset in your PR rather than creating a new one.

### Releasing

The first time a PR with a changeset is merged after a release, a new PR will automatically be created called `chore: version packages`. Any subsequent PRs with changesets will automatically update this existing version packages PR. Merging this PR triggers the release process by publishing to npm and cleaning up the changeset files.

### Creating a snapshot release

If a PR has changesets, you can create a [snapshot release](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/snapshot-releases.md) by [manually dispatching](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/abitype/actions/workflows/snapshot.yml) the Snapshot workflow. This publishes a tagged version to npm with the PR branch name and timestamp.

## Testing performance

Edit the `playground/trace.ts` file to include whatever code you want to test and run TypeScript's [built-in tracing tool](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Performance-Tracing) with the following command:

```bash
pnpm trace
```

This outputs a `playgrounds/performance/out/trace.json` file. You can open that file in a trace analysis app, like [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev) or `chrome://tracing`.
